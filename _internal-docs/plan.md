# 🧭 Suggested Build Order (Realistic)

If you want to *actually finish*:

2. Projects + Jokes
3. Admin panel basic
4. Auth + Likes
5. Tools (React)
6. 2FA
7. Monetisation

# ⚠️ Final Reality Check

If you try to:

> build everything at once → you’ll burn out

If you:

> ship Phase 1–3 first → you’ll already have a working CMS powering your portfolio
